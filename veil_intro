"Goodnight," a waving hand glides past the corner of your eye as your last
colleague leaves for the weekend.  A muffled hiss momentarily distracts you,
followed by a pleasant beep; the sterilization chamber letting someone out.  If
you had a choice, you'd be running after them, but you don't really have a
choice.  This software isn't going to write itself.  You have to get back to
work.
